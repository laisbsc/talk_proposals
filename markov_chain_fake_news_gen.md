# Markov Chain fake-news generator
* length: (initialy built to be 10 minutes)

## Summary
That 2020 was the year that no dreams came true we all agree. But that between Trump, aliens, pandemic, Australian and Brazilian forests on fire,
one thing we could all count on: **fake news**!

And since apparently such evil is here to stay, I've decided to write a simple Markov Chain sentence generator in Python to come up **fake news 
headlines** about the most erm... hairy subjects of the year. Bringing levity to despair, as we all should.

The result was quite fun and guarantee some laughs to welcome 2021.
