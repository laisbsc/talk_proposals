# Newbie is not nobody: How you can contribute to communities even if you are new

* Lenght: 30 - 40 minutes
* Presented at: 
  - PyData Amsterdam (my first talk ever!)
  
### Summary
Local communities are very good places to kick off a career in tech. For newcomers, having a safe space to hear about technologies, asking basic questions (no, 
they are not stupid!) can be quite daunting at first.
In this talk, I talk about how being part of the community can help newbies becoming more confident and prepared for the tech-world. I will show how even without
coding experience you can make a huge difference in your local community.
